January 13, 2026
Name: Lucas Timmerman
Changes: atomicForce.m, calculate_b_guessRho_eself.m, initialization.m, xc/exx/exx_initialization.m
1. Updated how unique rows are found to account for multiple sigma per Z or vice versa
2. Modified the rb_x calculation to be fixed at 5X sigma to avoid convergence issues
3. Modified how the fft is set up for HSE to work with even and odd number of grid points
